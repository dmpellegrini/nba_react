# This Is The Front End For Tony Wu's NBA API

This project was sourced from Tony Wu's ([github.com/tonywuhoo](https://github.com/tonywuhoo)'s) [NBA API](https://nbaapi-production.up.railway.app/)

His API was sourced from [This API](https://www.balldontlie.io/#introduction)

## Endpoints 

-- The endpoints of the API are simple so the front end is also simple
-- The "Teams" endpoint returns data for all the team names so it was used to display each team
-- If you type in the team abbreviation as a slug, it will return data on a single team 
-- The "Players" endpoint returned all players so it was used to display all 37 players in the database 
-- If you type in the player's last name as a slug, it will return data on as single player

## Featureset

-- The end points for all the teams and players were used as a way to give the user search options
-- The end points for the player and team searches were used to retrieve data based on the user submission
-- Although this API may have had full crud, capabilities, those endpoints were never provided in the documentation
